# **Dark Transactions**
## **Here I will use SQL and Python to analyze historical credit card transactions and consumption patterns in order to identify possible fraudulent transactions.**

### **Skills being illustrated:**

**- Data Modeling**
- One will find a Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)as an image saved as Database Diagram.png. One will also find documentation for said Diagram as a pdf saved as DBD Documentation.pdf. 

**- Data Engineering**
- One will find an SQL schema file saved as dark_transactions_schema.sql along with all of the necessary data saved as CSV files.

**- Data Analysis**
- One will find a JupyterNotebook saved as data_analysis.ipynb with all Python code.
